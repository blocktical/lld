# SOLID Principles – Clean Code & Better Design

Welcome to the **SOLID Principles** folder by **Blocktical** – your trusted platform for learning and issuing verifiable credentials in tech and education.

This repository contains curated examples, explanations, and code snippets demonstrating the five SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design. These principles help you write **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **flexible** software systems.

## 🧱 What are SOLID Principles?

**SOLID** is an acronym that represents five core design principles:

| Principle | Name                             | Description |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **S**     | **Single Responsibility Principle** | A class should have only one reason to change. |
| **O**     | **Open/Closed Principle**          | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. |
| **L**     | **Liskov Substitution Principle**  | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness. |
| **I**     | **Interface Segregation Principle**| No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. |
| **D**     | **Dependency Inversion Principle** | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. |
