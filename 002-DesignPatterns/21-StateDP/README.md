# ðŸ§¾ State Design Pattern

## ðŸ¤” What is it?

The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It avoids large conditional blocks by encapsulating state-based behavior in separate classes.

---

## ðŸ”§ Components:
- **Context**: Main object (e.g., Order)
- **State Interface**: Common interface for state behaviors
- **Concrete States**: Classes like `CreatedState`, `PaidState`, `ShippedState`

---

## ðŸ”¥ Why use it?

- Avoid if-else/switch-case clutter
- Add new states without breaking existing logic
- Clean, extensible, and testable code

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example Use Case

An Order moves from:
`Created â†’ Paid â†’ Shipped â†’ Delivered`

Each state defines what to do next.
