# 👥 Composite Pattern - Employee Hierarchy

This project demonstrates the **Composite Design Pattern** using a real-world scenario of a **Company’s Employee Hierarchy** in Python.

---

## 🧠 What is Composite Pattern?

Composite Pattern lets us treat **individual objects** and **composite groups** in a **uniform way**.

---
All `Employee` objects (developers, designers, managers, CEO) share:
- `get_salary()`
- `show_structure()`

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Organization Chart
- File Systems (Files & Folders)
- UI Component Trees
- DOM Trees

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
