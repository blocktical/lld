# 🏭 Log Parser Utility (Factory Design Pattern)

## 📘 About

This project demonstrates the use of **Factory Design Pattern** in a real-world scenario — parsing logs from different systems.

## 💡 Problem

Different systems generate different log formats. Writing separate logic or if-else statements everywhere makes the system messy and hard to maintain.

## ✅ Solution

Use Factory Pattern to delegate log parsing responsibility to appropriate parser class.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Modular design
- Factory Pattern

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
