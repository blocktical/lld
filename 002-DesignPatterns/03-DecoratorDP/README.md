# ‚òï Decorator Design Pattern in JavaScript

## üß† Concept

The **Decorator Pattern** lets you dynamically add behavior to objects without modifying their structure.

It is useful when:

- You want to add features to existing classes
- You don‚Äôt want to modify the original class
- You want to keep code clean, open for extension but closed for modification (SOLID Principle)

---

## üí° Example Scenario: Coffee Shop

- Base Object: `Coffee`
- Decorators: `Milk`, `Sugar`, `Cream`

---

## ‚ùå bad_example.js

Hardcoded logic. Difficult to extend.

## ‚úÖ good_example.js

Uses decorators to dynamically add features to `Coffee`.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

```bash
node good_example.js
```
