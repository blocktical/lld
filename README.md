# 🧱 Low Level Design (LLD) Repository

Welcome to the **Low Level Design (LLD)** folder! This repository is dedicated to helping you understand and master the concepts of Low Level Design through detailed explanations, structured examples, and practical problem statements.

## 📌 What is LLD?

Low Level Design focuses on the class-level and object-level design of a system. It involves identifying the components, responsibilities, relationships, and design patterns required to build scalable and maintainable software systems.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this folder is to:

- **Identify real-world problems** and break them down into smaller, manageable components.
- **Design scalable and extendable systems** using solid object-oriented principles and design patterns.
- Provide **hands-on examples** and **case studies** that mirror real interview scenarios.
- Develop a clear **problem-solving approach**, starting from requirements gathering to the final design.
  
## 📚 What You’ll Find

Inside this folder, you'll find:

- ✅ **Design Problems**: From basic to advanced LLD questions asked in tech interviews.
- ✅ **Detailed Explanations**: Each design includes step-by-step reasoning and design decisions.
- ✅ **UML Diagrams**: For visual representation of the systems.
- ✅ **Design Patterns in Action**: Applying patterns like Singleton, Strategy, Factory, etc.
- ✅ **Code Implementations**: Clean and modular code in Java/Python/C++ (as applicable).
- ✅ **Best Practices**: SOLID principles, object-oriented design, and clean code techniques.
